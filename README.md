üöÄ DynamicBatcher: Supercharge Your Transformer Inference with Intelligent Batching




Are you tired of slow Transformer inference due to excessive padding? When processing variable-length text sequences with Hugging Face models, standard batching often pads all sequences to a fixed max_length or the longest sequence in the entire dataset. This leads to wasted computation on padded tokens and inefficient GPU utilization.

DynamicBatcher is your solution! This intelligent batching utility minimizes padding overhead by grouping sequences of similar lengths together. The result? Significantly faster inference times and more efficient resource usage, especially critical for large-scale NLP applications.

‚ú® Key Features
Intelligent Length-Based Sorting: Automatically sorts input texts by their tokenized length.
Dynamic Padding: Batches are created such that sequences within each batch have similar lengths, minimizing padding only to the longest sequence within that specific batch.
Hugging Face Integration: Seamlessly works with AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForSequenceClassification (and other AutoModel types) from the Hugging Face ecosystem.
Performance Boost: Achieves substantial speedups for variable-length inputs compared to naive batching.
Easy to Use: A straightforward class that integrates effortlessly into your existing inference pipelines.

üöÄ Quick Start & Usage
Integrating DynamicBatcher into your inference workflow is straightforward.

Python

import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
from dynamic_batcher import DynamicBatcher # Assuming dynamic_batcher.py is in your path

# 1. Load your tokenizer and model
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased" # Or your preferred model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
model.eval() # Set model to evaluation mode

# 2. Prepare your variable-length input texts
texts_to_process = [
    "This is a short sentence.",
    "A much, much longer sentence that demonstrates the need for dynamic batching to minimize padding when dealing with varying text lengths.",
    "Hello world!",
    "Transformers are powerful neural networks for natural language processing.",
    "Another medium-length example text.",
    "Short.",
    # ... thousands more sentences with diverse lengths
]

# 3. Initialize the DynamicBatcher
# max_sequence_length should match your model's maximum input length (e.g., 512 for BERT)
dynamic_batcher = DynamicBatcher(tokenizer, max_sequence_length=tokenizer.model_max_length)

# 4. Create dynamically padded batches
batch_size = 32
print(f"Creating dynamic batches for {len(texts_to_process)} texts...")
dynamic_batches = dynamic_batcher.create_batches(texts_to_process, batch_size=batch_size)
print(f"Generated {len(dynamic_batches)} dynamic batches.")

# 5. Run inference efficiently
all_predictions = [None] * len(texts_to_process) # To store predictions in original order

with torch.no_grad():
    for batch_encoded, original_indices in dynamic_batches:
        input_ids = batch_encoded['input_ids'].to(device)
        attention_mask = batch_encoded['attention_mask'].to(device)

        outputs = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        logits = outputs.logits
        predictions = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1) # Example: classification

        # Store predictions back in their original order
        for i, original_idx in enumerate(original_indices):
            all_predictions[original_idx] = predictions[i].item()

print("\nInference complete! Predictions stored in original order.")
# print(all_predictions) # Uncomment to see predictions
üìä Performance Benchmark
To truly illustrate the power of DynamicBatcher, let's compare it against a standard naive batching approach on 5000 synthetic variable-length texts.

Benchmarking Setup:

Model: distilbert-base-uncased
Number of Texts: 5000
Text Lengths: Randomly varied from 5 to 100 words.
Batch Size: 32 (for both methods)
Device: CUDA (GPU) if available, otherwise CPU.
<!-- end list -->
